## Code Chunk Options

include = FALSE prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.  
echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.  
message = FALSE prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.  
warning = FALSE prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.  
fig.cap = "..." adds a caption to graphical results.
